# Will the Tundra Tracker be better full body trackers then the Vive Tracker?

[Tundra Labs](https://tundra-labs.com/), a company that makes and designs development kits for SteamVR tracking devices has announced their own full body trackers called the Tundra Trackers.

## Competition
Right now the only quality full body trackers out there are the Vive Trackers, so ofcourse there are gonna be comparisons between the Vive- and Tundra Trackers. The founder of Tundra Labs, Luke Beno, says the trackers will be better then the Vive Trackers in several ways.

When comparing the Vive and Tundra Trackers, the Tundra Tracker will be 60% smaller, consume 50% less power, weight 50% less and have double the battery life. He also says they will be slightly cheaper then the Vive Trackers alongside discounted tracker bundles. 

Though it seems like the Tundra Trackers are pure competition to the Vive Trackers, they can work together with the Vive Trackers, so that users that already own Vive Trackers can also use Tundra Trackers without having to switch from one tracker to another.

## Placement
Because the Tracker is smaller and weighs less, there are more places to put the trackers on your body.

The trackers base plate has two loops that a strap or shoe laces can fit through, allowing you to easily mount the trackers on your shoe laces.

The Trackers can also be placed on the wrist for precise motion tracking. They are also thinking about adding magnets so they can be placed on metal objects in clothing or for tracking objects around you if you have a small playspace.

## The kickstarter
Tundra Labs will run a Kickstarter for the Tundra Tracker. Their site for the [Tundra Tracker](https://www.tundratracker.com/) isnt finished yet, but you can sign up to their email to get notified when their new site is up.

Tundra Labs will offer 'multi port dongles' that will allow you to pair trackers with a single USB connection.
